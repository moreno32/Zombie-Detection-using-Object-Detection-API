# Zombie Detection using Object Detection API

## 🔄 Overview:
This project aims to develop a real-time zombie detection system using the Object Detection API and RetinaNet, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The model will be trained using a small dataset of just 5 zombie images, and fine-tuned to improve its performance. The system will be able to detect zombies in images and videos and will provide visual output of the detected zombies.

## 🎊 Motivation:
With the increasing popularity of zombies in popular culture, there is a growing interest in developing systems to detect them. This project aims to contribute to this field by developing a real-time zombies detection system that can be used for various applications such as video games, movies, and theme parks.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1) Understand the basic concepts and techniques of object detection
2) Learn how to use the TensorFlow Object Detection API and RetinaNet model
3) Gain experience in training and fine-tuning object detection models
4) Learn how to evaluate the performance of object detection models

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
The project will use the Object Detection API and RetinaNet, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The model will be trained using a small dataset of just 5 zombies images and fine-tuned to improve its performance. The system will be able to detect zombies in images and videos, and will provide visual output of the detected zombies.

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use the Object Detection API, RetinaNet, matplotlib, os, random, zipfile, io, scipy, numpy, glob, imageio, six, PIL, Ipython, and tensorflow.

## 📚 Data Source:
The project will use a small dataset of just 5 zombies images for training.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1) Import Object Detection API packages.
2) Data Preparation & Cleaning.
3) Visualize the training images.
4) Modeling.
5) Model Evaluation.
6) View and save results.

## 👥 Credits:
The Object Detection API and RetinaNet model were developed by the TensorFlow team. The project structure and implementation is inspired by the TensorFlow Object Detection API tutorial.
