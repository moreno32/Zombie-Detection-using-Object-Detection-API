# Zombie Detection using Object Detection API

## 🔄 Overview:
This project aims to develop a real-time zombie detection system using the Object Detection API and RetinaNet, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The model will be trained using a small dataset of just 5 zombie images, and fine-tuned to improve its performance. The system will be able to detect zombies in images and videos and will provide visual output of the detected zombies.
